# easy-debugging-doc

While your programming, there are some task you have to do over and over again when your creating or getting in a new project.
One of them is debugging your code.
Because I forget every time how to set up debugging, here is a simple step-by-step solution documentation.

Currently, there are the following how-to debugging docs:

- [Debugging in PHPStorm with Laravel in a Vagrant box (Homestead)](vagrant-laravel-phpstorm.md)
- [Debugging in PHPStorm with Laravel in a Docker Compose environment](docker-laravel-phpstorm.md)

## How to contribute
If you have a solution for debugging in another environment, please create a new markdown file and add it to the list above.
